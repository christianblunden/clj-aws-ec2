# clj-aws-ec2

A Clojure library for accessing Amazon EC2, based on the official AWS
Java SDK and borrowing heavily from James Reeves's [clj-aws-s3][]
library.

This is a very early development version. Currently the library only
supports functions to list/describe EC2 reservations, instances and
machine images (AMIs), and to start and stop EBS-backed instances. See
[TODO][] for future plans.

[TODO]: https://github.com/mrowe/clj-aws-ec2/wiki/TODO

## Install

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [clj-aws-ec2 "0.1.5"]

## Example

```clojure
(require '[aws.sdk.ec2 :as ec2])

(def cred {:access-key "...", :secret-key "..."})

(ec2/describe-instances cred)
(ec2/describe-instances cred (ec2/instance-id-filter "i-deadcafe"))

(ec2/describe-images cred (image-owner-filter "self"))
(ec2/describe-images cred (image-id-filter "ami-3c47a355"))

(ec2/start-instances cred "i-beefcafe")
(ec2/stop-instances cred "i-beefcafe" "i-deadbabe")

```

### Using regions

To use a region other than `us-east-1` you can specify an API endpoint
in the credentials map:

```clojure
(def cred {:access-key "...", :secret-key "...", :endpoint "ap-southeast-2"})
```

Refer to [Regions and Endpoints][] for a list of current EC2 endpoints.

[Regions and Endpoints]: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region

### Exception handling

You can catch exceptions and extract details of the error condition:

```clojure
(try
  (ec2/start-instances cred "i-beefcafe")
  (catch Exception e (ec2/decode-exception e)))
```

`ec2/decode-exception` provides a map with the following keys:

    :error-code
    :error-type
    :service-name
    :status-code
